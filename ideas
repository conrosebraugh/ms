1. make a list of all the processes (PID)
    a. find a way to get all the directory names from inside a directory
    b. names that are solely number in /proc are processes
2. (RES)
    a. this is found in statm[1]
3. (USS)
    a. might be possible with statm
        i. subtract nmber of shared pages (statm[2]) from rss (statm[1]) 
4. (SHR)
    a. probably statm[2]. not entirely sure
5. (PSS)
    a. CAN NOT BE DONE WITH STATM
    b. will be very slow
    c. dictionary of pages
        i. key is page number
        ii. value is list of processes page
6. (SWAP)
    a. CAN NOT BE DONE WITH STATM
7. (CMD)
    a. /proc/PID/cmdline maybe. Not sure if we need to parse out args to the command


Notes:
- Total memory size is found in meminfo

- the following python will return a python list of the pages in your machine:
kpf = open('/proc/kpagecount', 'rb')
cnts = kpf.read()
vals = [ cnts[i:i+8] for i in range(0, len(cnts), 8)]
// OR vals = [ cnts[i:i+8] for i in range(0, NUMPAGES, 8)]
// where NUMPAGES = (total amount of memory)/(page size)
pgcnts = [struct.unpack('q',v)[0] for v in vals ]

- "getconf PAGESIZE" gets you the page size. there is probably a python func for this
